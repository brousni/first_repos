first_repos
===========

an attempt on creating a first repository

The project is not divided into a lot of functions at this point
but mainly consists of a 3 case main program, which calls a few functions when reading on the One-Wire
which at this point is programmed for reading of temparature from a DS18B2C.

The project is set to run on the external makefile, why, this should be created by the user before running AVR.
There is a readme file in the write_Makefile folder that will instruct how to create the makefile

Afterwards, the object files can either be build in AVR or by the MAKE_ALL in the gnu make folder
